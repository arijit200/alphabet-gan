# Alphabet GAN

This Project was made in my Final Year Btech Project to showcase the power of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN).

Our Task was to generatively build the entirety of the English and Bengali Alphabet using GAN and show that synthetically generated text is as close as real Handwritten text.

This was built using Tensorflow and some other packages.
